The goal of this challenge was to identify woman's cervix type based on images. More specifically, three types of cervix need to be classified here which can lead to real-time determinations about patientsâ€™ treatment eligibility based on cervix type.
This repository contains the keras solution files of the competition. Results produced from the pipeline was ranked 7th in the competition.

# The problem

- Imbalanced class.
- Too few training images. External data can not be found easily.
- Area of interest was smaller than the image provided.


The problem was approached in 2 stages:

1. Train an object detector ([R-FCN](https://github.com/YuwenXiong/py-R-FCN) - Caffe) and crop out ROIs autometically.
2. Classify the cropped ROIs using a seperate model (VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception, Res50) ([Keras](https://keras.io/applications/)).

This repository only contains the 2nd part of the solution. Therefore, only keras implementation is available here. Thanks to [ZFTurbo](https://github.com/ZFTurbo) for his [keras implementation](https://www.kaggle.com/zfturbo/fishy-keras-lb-1-25267) on Fisheries Monitoring classification challange.

# Requirements

- tensorflow
- Keras
- scipy
- numpy
- pandas
- opencv-python
- scikit-image


# Data

Place 'train'and 'test' data folders in the 'input' folder. Input folder also contains the manual annotation of the ROI's for R-CNN training.

# Train

Run train_finetune_5fld.py (loads all training images to memory)

or 

Run train_finetune_from_directory.py (reads images from hard drive in mini-batches) to train on imagenet pretrained models.

# Test and submit

Run submit.py to predict and generate submissions
